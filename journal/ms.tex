  \abstract{Children tend to produce words earlier when they are connected to a
variety of other words along both the phonological and semantic
dimensions. Though this connectivity effect has been extensively
documented, little is known about the underlying developmental
mechanism. One view suggests that learning is primarily driven by a
network growth model where highly connected words in the child's early
lexicon attract similar words. Another view suggests that learning is
driven by highly connected words in the external learning environment
instead of highly connected words in the early internal lexicon. The
present study tests both scenarios systematically in both the
phonological and semantic domains across 10 languages. We show that
external connectivity in the learning environment drives growth in both
production- and comprehension-based vocabularies. The findings suggest a
word learning mechanism where children harness their statistical
learning abilities to (indirectly) detect and learn highly connected
words in the learning environment.}

\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}

What factors shape vocabulary learning over the course of early
childhood? To investigate this question, scientists have adopted
multiple research strategies, from conducting controlled laboratory
experiments (e.g. Markman, 1990) to analyzing dense corpora capturing
language learning in context (e.g., B. C. Roy, Frank, DeCamp, Miller, \&
Roy, 2015). One strategy consists in documenting the timeline of words'
acquisition, and studying the properties that make words easy or hard to
learn. For example, within a lexical category, words that are more
frequent in child-directed speech are acquired earlier (J. C. Goodman,
Dale, \& Li, 2008). Other factors include word length, the mean length
of utterances in which the word occurs, and concreteness (see Braginsky,
Yurovsky, Marchman, \& Frank, 2016).

Besides these word-level properties, the lexical structure (that is, how
words relate to each other) also influences the age of acquisition of
words. The lexical structure can be characterized in terms of a network
where each node represents a word in the vocabulary, and each link
between two nodes represents a relationship between the corresponding
pair of words (e.g., Collins and Loftus, 1975). Previous studies have
investigated early vocabulary structure by constructing networks using a
variety of word-word relations including shared semantic features,
target-cue relationships in free association norms, co-occurrence in
child directed speech, and phonological relatedness. These studies have
found that children tend to produce words that have higher neighborhood
density (i.e., high connectivity in the network) earlier, both at the
phonological and the semantic level (Carlson, Sonderegger, \& Bane,
2014; Hills, Maouene, Riordan, \& Smith, 2010; Hills, Maouene, Maouene,
Sheya, \& Smith, 2009; Stella, Beckage, \& Brede, 2017; Storkel, 2009).

While most studies have focused on the static properties of the lexical
network, a few have investigated the underlying developmental process.
In particular, Steyvers and Tenenbaum (2005) suggested that the observed
effects of connectivity are the consequence of how the lexical network
gets constructed in the child's mind. According to this explanation,
known as Preferential Attachment, highly connected words in the child's
lexicon tend to \enquote{attract} more words over time, in a
rich-get-richer scenario (Barabasi \& Albert, 1999). In other words,
what predicts word learning is the \emph{internal} connectivity in the
child's early lexicon. In contrast, Hills et al. (2009) suggested that
what biases the learning is not the connectivity in the child's internal
lexicon but, rather, \emph{external} connectivity in the learning
environment. They called this alternative explanation Preferential
Acquisition. For clarity of reading, we will call preferential
attachment the Internally-driven mechanism (INT), and preferential
acquisition the Externally-driven mechanism (EXT).
Figure~\ref{fig:growth} shows an illustration of both growth scenarios
with the same simplified network. These two proposals represent two
divergent ideas about the role of lexical networks in acquisition. On
the INT proposal, network structure is a causal factor in early word
learning; in contrast, on the EXT approach, network structure is not
internally represented and, therefore, might be an epiphenomenon of the
statistics of the linguistic input.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=300px]{figs/growth3} 

}

\caption{Illustration of the two growth scenarios. Filled grey circles represent known words (Internal) at a certain point in time. The empty, numbered circles represent words that have not yet been learned (External) and which are candidates to enter the lexicon next. The identity of the word that is going to be learned depends on the growth scenario.  Here the squares indicate the node that drives growth in each scenario and the hand pointer indicates which word is likely to be learned. For INT, the utility of a candidate, external node is the average degree (i.e., number of links) of the internal nodes that it would attach to. Thus, according to INT, the node 1 is more likely to enter the lexicon. For EXT, the utility of a candidate node is its degree in the entire network. According to EXT, the node 2 is more likely to enter the lexicon next.}\label{fig:growth}
\end{figure}

Hills et al. (2009) found that early lexical networks do not grow
through INT as was originally hypothesised by Steyvers and Tenenbaum
(2005), but rather through EXT. This finding, though potentially very
profound, has only been established in the special case of networks that
are based on 1) semantic associations, 2) production-based vocabularies,
and 2) data from English-learning children, only. The extent to which
this result depends on the domain, the measure and culture/language is
still unclear. In this work, we test the generality of the finding along
these three dimensions.

First, we study the phonological network in addition to the semantic
network. These two networks represent different ways the mental lexicon
is structured. In particular, words that are neighbors in the semantic
network (e.g., \enquote{cat}, \enquote{dog}) are not necessarily
neighbors in the phonological network, and vice versa. Does the
phonological network also influence word learning? Previous work did
find an effect of words' connectivity in the phonological network on
their age of learning (Carlson et al., 2014; Stella et al., 2017;
Storkel, 2009). In other words, words learned earlier in life tend to
sound similar to many other words than a word learned later in life.
However, this finding is compatible with both INT and EXT, and previous
studies did not explicitly compare these two mechanisms. Here, we
investigate whether phonological networks, like semantic networks, grow
through EXT, or if they rather grow via INT (Figure~\ref{fig:growth}).

Second, we study vocabularies measured using both comprehension and
production. Previous studies have found differences between these
vocabularies in terms of their content and rate of acquisition
(Benedict, 1979; Fenson et al., 1994). These differences may reflect the
fact that comprehension and production do not share the same
constraints. For instance, whereas comprehension depends on the ease
with which words are stored and accessed, production depends,
additionally, on the ease with which words are articulated, e.g.,
shorter words are produced earlier (Braginsky et al., 2016). By
investigating comprehension-based vocabularies, we assess the extent to
which the network growth mechanism captures general learning patterns
beyond the specific constraints of production.

Finally, we use developmental data in 10 languages. Lexical networks can
show more or less cross-linguistic variability along both the semantic
and phonological domains (Arbesman, Strogatz, \& Vitevitch, 2010; Youn
et al.,
2016).\footnote{The difference is more obvious in the phonological case where the network structureâ€“â€“and the distribution of word connectivityâ€“â€“can a priori change from language to language depending on various languistic conventions.}
Besides, cultures might differ in the way caregivers talk to children
(Cristia, Dupoux, Gurven, \& Stieglitz, 2017; Kuhl et al., 1997), and
this difference in the input could influence the chidlren's learning
strategy. Thus, Cross-linguistic comparison is crucial to test what
mechanism is cognitively universal and is used by all children, and what
mechanism is specific to some patterns of learning that emerge due to
the particulars of a given language or culture (Bates \& MacWhinney,
1987; Slobin, 2014).

The paper is organized as follows. First, we describe the datasets we
used and explain how we constructed the networks. Second, we analyze
static properties of words' connectivity in these networks (correlation
with AoA and shape of the distribution) and we explain how these
properties infom hypotheses about network growth. Next, we explicitly
fit the two hypothesized growth mechanisms to the data. We investigate
the extent to which the results obtained in Hills et al. (2009)
generalize to phonological networks and comprehension-based
vocabularies, and whether this generalization holds
cross-linguistically.

\section{Networks}\label{networks}

\subsection{Data}\label{data}

We used data from Wordbank (Frank, Braginsky, Yurovsky, \& Marchman,
2017), an open repository aggregating cross-linguistic language
developmental data of the MacArthur-Bates Communicative Development
Inventory (CDI), a parent report vocabulary checklist. Parent report is
a reliable and valid measure of children's vocabulary that allows for
the cost-effective collection of datasets large enough to test
network-based models of acquisition (Fenson et al., 1994). When filling
out a CDI form, caregivers are either invited to indicate whether their
child \enquote{understands} (comprehension) or \enquote{understands and
says} (production) each of about 400-700 words. For younger children
(e.g., 8 to 18 months in the English data), both comprehension and
production are queried, whereas for older children (16 to 36 months)
only production is queried. We use data from younger children to test
comprehension and data from older children to test production across 10
languages. Following previous studies (Hills et al., 2009; Storkel,
2009), we restrict our analysis to nouns. Table \ref{tab:stats} gives an
overview of the data.

\subsection{Age of acquisition}\label{age-of-acquisition}

For each word in the CDI data, we compute the proportion of children who
understand or produce the word at each month. Then we fit a logistic
curve to these proportions and determined when the curve crosses 0.5,
i.e., the age at which at least 50\% of children know the word. We take
this point in time to be each word's age of acquisition (Braginsky et
al., 2016; J. C. Goodman et al., 2008).

Turkish & 180 & 8-16 & 297 & 16-36\\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\subsection{Semantic networks}\label{semantic-networks}

We constructed semantic networks for English data following the
procedure outlined in Hills et al. (2009), as follows. We used as an
index of semantic relatedness the Florida Free Association Norms
(Nelson, McEvoy, \& Schreiber, 1998). This dataset was collected by
giving adult participants a word (the cue), and asking them to write the
first word that comes to mind (the target). For example, when given the
word \enquote{ball}, they might answer with the word \enquote{game}. A
pair of nodes were connected by a directed link from the cue to the
target if there was a cue-target relationship between these nodes in the
association norms. The connectivity of a given node was characterized by
its \emph{indegree}: the number of links for which the word was the
target. To model growth from month to month, we constructed a different
network at each month, based on the words that have been acquired by
that month.

Since the free association norms are available only in English, we used
the hand-checked translation equivalents available in Wordbank, which
allowed us to use the English association norms across languages. Using
the same association data across languages does not necessarily mean
that the resulting networks will be the same across languages, or that
these networks will grow similarly. Indeed, though this approximation
assumes that the semantic similarity measure is universal----which is a
reasonable assumption (e.g., Youn et al. 2015), the set of words
acquired by children as well as the timeline of this acquisition can
still vary from language to language leading to possibility different
learning strategies.

\subsection{Phonological networks}\label{phonological-networks}

To construct phonological networks we first mapped the orthographic
transcription of words to their International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)
transcriptions in each language, using the open source text-to-speech
software \textbf{\href{http://http://espeak.sourceforge.net/}{Espeak}.}
We used the Levenshtein distance (also known as edit distance) as a
measure of phonological relatedness between two nodes. The measure
counts the minimum number of operations (insertions, deletions,
substitutions) required to change one string into another.

In previous studies, two nodes were linked if they had an edit distance
of 1 (Carlson et al., 2014; Stella et al., 2017; Storkel, 2009).
However, these studies reported a contribution of phonological networks
to word learning when these networks were built using a rich adult
vocabulary. However, since the focus of the current study is on the
mechanism of growth, the networks should be based on the children's
early vocabulary which, nevertheless, contains very few word pairs with
an edit distance of 1. Thus, we increased the threshold from 1 to 2,
that is, two nodes were related if their edit distance was equal to 1 or
2.\footnote{We also considered the case of an edit distance of 1 as well as the continuous measure, i.e., the inverse edit distance without threshold. In both cases, the results were weaker that those done with a threshold of 2.}
The connectivity of a given node was characterized with its
\emph{degree}: the number of links it shares with other words.

\section{Analysis}\label{analysis}

\subsection{Static properties of the global
network}\label{static-properties-of-the-global-network}

We start by analyzing word connectivity in the global (static) network.
We constructed this network using nouns learned by the oldest age for
which we have CDI data (e.g., in English this corresponds, in
comprehension, to the network by 18 months, and in production, to the
network by 30 months). This global network is the end-state towards
which both INT and EXT converge by the last month of learning. Moreover,
following Hills et al. (2009), we used this end-state network as a proxy
for the external connectivity in the learning environment. Below we
analyze properties of this global networks that are relevant to INT
and/or EXT. In order to compare various predictors on the same data, we
restrict the analysis to the subset of nouns for which we had both
semantic and phonological information in each language.

\begin{figure}[!h]
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{ms_files/figure-latex/corrAll-1} \caption{Age of production (A) and comprehension (B) in the global network as predicted by the degree (i.e., connectivity) in this network. Results are shown in each language for phonological and semantic networks. Each point is a word, with lines indicating linear model fits, and numbers indicating the Pearson correlation coefficients.}\label{fig:corrAll}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Connectivity predicts the age of
acquisition}\label{connectivity-predicts-the-age-of-acquisition}

Connectivity in the global network is directly related to EXT as it
represents the explicit criterion this growth scenario uses to determine
what words should be learned first (Figure \ref{fig:growth}). Therefore,
a direct consequence of an EXT-like growth scenario is a correlation
between connectivity in the global network and the age of
acquisition.\footnote{This correlation is also compatible with INT, although the causality is reversed. Indeed, from the perspective of this growth scenario, higher connectivity in the global network is caused by earlier learning, not the other way around. Some words end up being highly connected in the global network precisely because they happen to be acquired earlier and, therefore, have a higher chance of accumulating more links over time.}
Figure \ref{fig:corrAll} shows how the age of production and
comprehension for each word varies as a function of its degree (or
indegree for the semantic networks) as well as the correlation values.
For ease of visual comparison, the predictor (i.e., the degree) was
centered and scaled across languages.

The plots show, overall, a negative correlation between the month of
acquisition and the degree. In production data, the average correlation
across languages was -0.24 (SD=0.10) for the semantic networks and -0.30
(SD=0.05) for the phonological networks. In comprehension data, the
average correlation was -0.21 (SD=0.08) for the semantic networks and
-0.21 (SD=0.07) for the phonological networks. These results indicate
that nouns with higher degrees are generally learned earlier, thus
replicating previous findings in English (e.g., Storkel 2004, 2009;
Hills et al. 2009) and extending these findings to ten different
languages (with few exceptions) in both production- and
comprehension-based vocabularies.

\begin{figure}[!h]
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{ms_files/figure-latex/degreeDist-1} \caption{Log-log plot of the cumulative degree distribution function for the global phonological and semantic networks across languages. The figure shows the results for both production and comprehension data. A perfect power-law distribution should appear as a straight line in this graph.}\label{fig:degreeDist}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Power-law degree
distribution}\label{power-law-degree-distribution}

We also analyzed the global network's degree distribution. The shape of
this distribution is particularly relevant to INT as this growth
scenario is known to generate networks with a power-law degree
distribution, i.e., a distribution of the form
\(p(k) \propto \frac{1}{k^{\alpha}}\) (Barabasi \& Albert, 1999). If the
network displays this property, this fact would suggest an INT-like
generative process. Conversely, if the degree distribution does not
follow a power law, this fact would weaken the case for INT. The log-log
plots are shown in Figure \ref{fig:degreeDist}. We fit a power law to
each empirical degree distribution following the procedure outlined in
Clauset, Shalizi, and Newman (2009) and using a related R package
(poweRlaw, Gillespie, 2015).

In brief, the analysis consisted in two steps. First, we derived the
optimal cut-off, \(k_{min}\), above which the distribution is more
likely to follow a power
law,\footnote{In natural phenomena, it is often the case that the power law applies only for values above a certain minimum.}
and we estimate the corresponding scaling parameter \(\alpha\). Second
we calculated the goodness-to-fit, which resulted in a \(p\)-value
quantifying the plausibility of the model. The results are shown in
Table \ref{tab:powerLawProd} for production data, and in Table
\ref{tab:powerLawComp} for comprehension data.

Overall, we could not reject the null hypothesis of a power-law
distribution: The \(p\)-value was generally above 0.1 in almost all
languages for both production and comprehension. That said, phonological
networks had relatively larger cut-offs than semantic networks. As was
suggested by Arbesman et al. (2010), these \enquote{truncated}
power-laws in phonological networks ----as well as the observed
cross-linguistic variability in the value of the cut-offs---- may
reflect the various constraints that exist on word formation such as the
number of phonemes in the language, the phonotactics (i.e., the way
sound sequences are arranged in words), and the length of words. Such
constraints may limit the number of words that are phonologically
similar, thus leading to distributions which decay faster than a
non-truncated power law.

In sum, the static properties of the global network are \emph{a priori}
compatible with both INT and EXT. In order to decide between these two
developmental scenarios, we need to fit explicit growth models to the
data.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Network growth models}\label{network-growth-models}

To test the network growth scenarios, we fit two growth models to the
data. We calculated the probability that a word \(w_i\), with a utility
value \(u_i\) would enter the lexicon at a given month, using a softmax
function:

\begin{equation}
 p(w_i)= \frac{e^{\beta u_i}}{\sum_j e^{\beta u_j} }
\end{equation}

\noindent where \(\beta\) is a fitted parameter that captures the
magnitude of the relationship between network parameters and growth
(analogous to a regression coefficient). A positive value of \(\beta\)
means that words with higher utility values \(u_i\) are acquired first,
and a negative value means that words with lower utility values are
acquired first (see Figure \ref{fig:growth} for an illustration of how
utilities values \(u_i\) are defined in each growth scenario). The
normalization includes all words that could be learned at that month.

We estimated the parameter \(\beta\) using a Bayesian approach. The
inference was performed using the probabilistic programming language
WebPPL (N. Goodman \& Stuhlmuller, 2014). We defined a uniform prior
over \(\beta\), and at each month, we computed the likelihood function
over words that could possibly enter the lexicon at that month, fit to
the words that have been learned at that month (using formula 1). Markov
Chain Monte Carlo sampling resulted in a posterior distribution over
\(\beta\), which we summarized in Figure \ref{fig:growthPred}.

First, the results replicate Hills et al.'s original finding regarding
the semantic network in English and production data, which is that this
network grows by EXT, not by INT. Second, our results show that,
generally speaing, this finding generalizes to comprehension, and holds
across languages. This generalization was obtained in both the
semantic\footnote{One could imagine that the fact of using English free association norms cross-linguistically would decrease the effect of non-English semantic networks because of possible cultural differences. However, our findings do not support this assumption, rather it supports our initial approximation about the universality of the semantic similarity measure.}
and phonological domains.

\subsection{Comparison to other predictors of age of
acquisition}\label{comparison-to-other-predictors-of-age-of-acquisition}

Above we showed that the way semantic and phonological information is
structured in the learning environment contributes to noun learning (via
EXT) across languages. However, we know that other factors influence
learning as well (e.g., Braginsky et al., 2016). Next we investigated
how semantic and phonological connectivity interact with two other
factors. The first one is word frequency, a well studied factor shown to
predict the age of acquisition in a reliable fashion (e.g. J. C. Goodman
et al., 2008). The second factor is word length, which was shown to
correlate with phonological connectivity: Shorter words are more likely
to have higher connectivity (Pisoni et al., 1985; Vitevitch and
Rodriguez, 2004).

Since we found INT to be uninformative, we dropped it from this
analysis, keeping only EXT. This simplified the model because we no
longer needed to fit growth month-by-month. The latter was a requirement
only for INT where the words' utilities varied from month to month,
depending on how connectivity changed in the growing internal network. A
more direct way to assess and compare the contribution of EXT in
relation to other word-level factors is through conducting linear
regressions, where connectivity in the learning environment, frequency
and length predict the age of acquisition.

For word length, we counted the number of phonemes in our generated IPA
transcription. For word frequency, we used the frequency estimates from
Braginsky et al. (2016) where unigram counts were derived based on
CHILDES corpora in each language (MacWhinney, 2000). For each word,
counts included words that shared the same stem (e.g., \enquote{cats}
counts as \enquote{cat}), or words that were synonymous (e.g.
\enquote{father} counts as \enquote{daddy}). Although these frequency
counts use transcripts from independent sets of children, they are based
on large samples, and this allows us to average out possible differences
between children and the specificities of their input (see Goodman et
al. 2008).

We conducted two analyses. We fit a linear regression for each language,
and we fit a linear mixed-effect model to all the data pooled across
languages, with language as a random effect. Figure \ref{fig:staticPred}
shows the coefficient estimate for each predictor in each language for
production and comprehension data. Figure \ref{fig:staticAll} shows the
coefficient estimates for all languages combined (all predictors were
centered and scaled).

The findings for the new predictors were as follows. Overall, frequency
is the largest and most consistent predictor of age of acquisition in
both comprehension and production data and across languages, endorsing
results for nouns across a variety of analyses (Braginsky et al., 2016;
J. C. Goodman et al., 2008; B. C. Roy et al., 2015). Word length is more
predictive for production than comprehension (and this difference is
very clear in the global model), replicating previous work (Braginsky et
al., under review). Thus, word length seems to reflect the effects of
production's constraints rather than than comprehension's constraints,
i.e., longer words are harder to articulate but they may not be
significantly more difficult to store and access.

As for the factors of interest, i.e., semantic and phonological
connectivity, we found cross-linguistic differences. Connectivity
contributes to learning in some languages but not in other. In
particular, semantic connectivity does not explain variance in English
data beyond that explained by phonological connectivity, frequency and
length. This contrasts with the original finding in Hills et al. (2009).
However, in this previous study, semantic connectivity was not tested in
a model that included frequency, length and phonological connectivity as
covariates. Another important difference is the number of words tested:
Our study uses a larger set of nouns. That said, and despite these
apparent cross-linguistic differences, both phonological and semantic
connectivity are significant predictors in the combined model.

\section{Discussion}\label{discussion}

This study provided an analysis of network growth during development. We
compared two network growth scenarios described in the pioneering work
of Steyvers and Tenenbaum (2005) and Hills et al. (2009). The first
scenario, INT (originally called Preferential Attachment), described a
rich-get-richer network growth model in which the current structure of
the learner's internal network determines future growth; the other, EXT
(originally called Preferential Acquisition) described a model in which
the external, global environmental network structure determines
learners' growth patterns. These two mechanisms represent two
fundamentally different accounts of lexical growth: one suggests that
future word knowledge is primarily shaped by the children's past
knowledge and its organization, whereas the other suggests that learning
is shaped, rather, by salient properties in the input regardless of how
past knowledge is organized.

Previous work (Hills et al., 2010, 2009) has been limited in its scope:
It focused primarily on semantic networks, production-based
vocabularies, and developmental data from English-learning children. The
present study tested the generality of previous findings by 1)
investigating phonological networks together with semantic networks, 2)
testing both comprehension- and production-based vocabularies, and 3)
comparing the results across 10 languages.

We found that the original findings reported in Hills et al. (2009)
generalize well across all these dimensions. First, just like semantic
networks, phonological networks grow via the externally-driven scenario
(EXT), not by the internally-driven mechanism (INT). Second,
comprehension-based vocabularies grow in a way similar to
production-based vocabularies. Finally, the findings were, overall,
similar across the 10 languages we tested. Although we find some
cross-linguistic variation when semantic and phonological networks were
pitted against frequency and length, this variability is to be taken
with a grain of salt as it might be exaggerated in our study by the
limited and partially-overlapping sample of nouns for each language. In
fact, both phonological and semantic connectivity are significant
predictors above and beyond frequency and length when data are pooled
across languages.

These findings corroborate the hypothesis that children start by
learning words that have high similarity to a variety of other words in
the learning environment, not in the child's available lexicon. This
means, strikingly, that children are sensitive to highly connected words
although they do not initially have access to the full network. This
finding raises some important questions. What mechanism allows children
to distinguish highly connected words from other words? Besides, why
would highly connected words be easier to learn?

One possibility is that children rely on their statistical learning
abilities. For example, in the semantic domain, children might be using
a mechanism akin to cross-situational learning to pick up the meanings
of some words, especially concrete nouns (Smith \& Yu, 2008), and such
learning would resemble the growth scenario described by EXT. Indeed,
since free association is related to contextual co-occurrence (Griffiths
et al., 2007), highly connected words will tend to occur in a variety of
speech and referential contexts. This fact makes such words easier to
learnonly because they have more referential disambiguating cues across
learning contexts, and crucially, even without knowing the entire set of
words with witch they occurs (hence the similarity with EXT). This
possibility is supported by the finding that words' diversity of
occurrence in child directed speech predicts their age of learning
(Hills et al., 2010).

In the phonological case, network growth according to EXT is also
compatible with a scenario whereby children are tracking lwo level
statistical patterns, e.g., high probability sound sequences. Indeed,
connectivity in the phonological network is inherently correlated with
phonotactic probability (M. S. Vitevitch, Luce, Pisoni, \& Auer, 1999).
That is, highly connected words tend to be made of frequent sound
sequences. Children are sensitive to local phonotactic regularities
(Jusczyk, Luce, \& Charles-Luce, 1994) and this sensitivity might lead
them to learn higher-probability words more easily (e.g., Storkel,
2001). This explanation is supported by computational simulations that
shows how learning general phonotactics patterns create ``well-worn
paths'' which allow the models to represent several distinct but
phonologically neighboring words (Dell et al; 1993; Takac et al. 2017).

Besides using their own statistical learning skills, children could also
benefit from the way their caregivers speak. Perhaps the caregivers put
more emphasis on the words that are highly connected in \emph{their}
mature lexical network. This emphasis would guide children to learn
first these highly connected words even though children do not have
access to the distribution of words' connectivity in the final network.
Investigating this possibility would require further research on
caregiver-child interaction (MacWhinney, 2014; B. C. Roy et al., 2015),
examining what words are introduced over development and the extent to
which children's uptake is influenced by this input (Clark 2007; Hoff
and Naigles, 2002; Hurtado et al., 2008).

This work shares a number of limitations with previous studies using
similar research strategy and datasets (e.g., Hills et al. 2009; 2010).
Chief among these limitations is the fact that the age of word
acquisition is computed using different children at different ages (due
to the fact that available CDI data is mainly cross-sectional). Although
this measure has proven highly consistent (Fensen et al. 1994), it lead
us to focus on studying the learning mechanism of the \enquote{average}
child. Individual trajectories, however, could show different learning
patterns. For example, using longitudinal data Beckage, Smith, and Hills
(2011) found differences between typical and late talkers in terms of
the semantic network structure. Besides, although our study endorses the
externally-driven account of network growth, this does not mean
individual children never use some variant of INT or some combination of
both INT and EXT (Beckage and Colunga, under review). For example, some
children develop \enquote{islands of expertise}, that is, well organized
knowledge about a certain topic (e.g., birds or dinosaurs). This prior
knowledge enables these children to learn new related words more easily
(e.g., Chi and Koeske, 1983).

To conclude, our work validates and generalizes previous results in
early network development. It suggests that the advantage of highly
connected words may result, at least in the early stages of word
learning, from the operation of simpler mechanisms in both the semantic
and phonological domains. One question for future experimental work is
whether such correlational patterns of growth can be produced in
controlled behavioral experiments.
